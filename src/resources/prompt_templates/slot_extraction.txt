## ATTENTION

your result MUST be a json string without anything else, like this:

{
    "chain of thought": "...", // should start with "let's think step by step, first the request of user is $request, consider the relationship between it with the previous request, ..."
    "entity name1": "value of entity1",  // the ENTITY NAME MUST listed in Entities info
    "entity name2": "value of entity2",
    ...
}
